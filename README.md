# Rol-Tabletop-Simulator
###I am not focused on this project for now. I want to learn web development properly to continue this project.

## But, what's this?

I am a huge fan of roleplaying games (like Anima: Beyond fantasy, Pathfinder, Call of C'thulu...etc) and I though that it should be great to have my own
platform to simulate tabletop games (drag and drop sprites, importing lands and something else).
